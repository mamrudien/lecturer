\begin{problem}{Mathematics Lecturer}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

Pak Blangkon is a mathematics lecturer at Gudang Mantu University who likes positive integers $N$.

One day, while teaching, he surprisingly asked his students a question,
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $a$ and $b$ are each non-negative integer less than $N$ where $a \neq b$,
\item Then suppose $S$ is a set where $a,b\in{S}$,
\item For any $x,y \in S$ where $x \neq y$, then $z\in S$ where $z=(x+y)\operatorname{mod}N$.
\item How many members is $S$?
\end{itemize}

Try to answer Pak Blangkon's question!

\InputFile
The first line contains a positive integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1000$) --- the number of test cases in the input.

The next $T$ lines each contain three integers $N$, $a$, and $b$ ($2\leq{N}\leq{10^{18}}, 0 \le a,b<{N},a\neq{b}$) separated by spaces.

\OutputFile
For each test case print a non-negative integer representing the number of members of $S$.
